# TelegramBot

## A Telegram Bot made by ME

Recently I've been wanting to experiment with APIs a little bit so I figured I would
make a telegram bot that could help me retrieve some data I am interested in.
Currently it has a few commands such as:
- /stock (stock symbol) - Retrieves data about the stock from the alphavantage api
- /graph (stock symbol) - Retrieves a graph of the stock in the last few years (small experiment with matplotlib)
- /maple - Retrieves the latest maplestory posts on the maplestory.com website
- /time <timezone> (PDT/UTC/CET) - Retrieves the current time of the timezone based on the worldtimeapi.org

Would update the code more if I encounter other IDEAS!

**MAKE SURE YOU SET THE API KEYS BEFORE RUNNING THE BOT (KEYS FOR TELEGRAM_API & ALPHAVANTAGE_API)**

### Any ideas/recommendations are welcome!
